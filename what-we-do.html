      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        This project involves designing and implementing a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) system for a large organization with offices distributed across multiple geographic locations. The goal is to improve their data storage, sharing, and processing capabilities by establishing a comprehensive SDI. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
        As part of this, a web GeoPortal was developed to demonstrate the functionality of the spatial data infrastructure design. This includes establishing a Geo-Database containing sufficient spatial data for the system, creating a data clearinghouse to enable metadata-driven searching, and developing web mapping services (WMS) and web feature services (WFS) to present and interact with GIS data. The project focuses specifically on Cape Town as the study area, using the Chief Directorate: National Geo-spatial Information (CDNGI) as the case study.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
        The web portal connects the Geo-Database, metadata clearinghouse, and web services, providing an integrated platform for spatial data access and management tailored to the organization’s needs.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">What We Provide</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        The CDNGI Geoportal provides users with centralized access to spatial data resources focused on the Cape Town area. It features an interactive web map that allows users to visually explore available datasets and engage with geospatial layers such as aerial imagery, elevation models, cadastral boundaries, and geodetic control points. The portal also includes a metadata catalogue, which serves as a searchable data clearinghouse. Within the catalogue, users can view detailed metadata for each dataset, access Web Feature Services (WFS) and Web Mapping Services (WMS) links for direct GIS integration, and download files directly for certain datasets. This setup supports both interactive visualization and practical use of spatial data in desktop GIS applications. The geoportal is built to enhance data discoverability, accessibility, and usability—key goals in the implementation of spatial data infrastructures.
